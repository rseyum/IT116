              Washington officially the State of Washington, is a state in the
              Pacific Northwest region of the Western United States. Named for
              George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was formed
              from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded
              by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon
              Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The
              state, which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon
              to the south, Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of
              British Columbia to the north—was admitted to the Union as the
              42nd state in 1889.

              New York is a state in the Northeastern United States. It is

              Long Island.[6][9][10][11] The state is bordered by New Jersey and
              Pennsylvania to the south, and Connecticut, Massachusetts, and
              Vermont to the east; it has a maritime border with Rhode Island,
              east of Long Island, as well as an international border with the
              Canadian provinces of Quebec to the north and Ontario to the
              northwest.

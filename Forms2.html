in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews.

and also allows exact size for the text area to take and the placeholder that says hey Rahel is placed on the
text area that is a hint for users where to write.

        <textarea
          id=" requests"
          name=""
          textArea
          rows="5"
          cols="5"
          placeholder="Hey Rahel!"
        ></textarea>
